# News App (React)

This is a React-based news application that fetches news headlines from the News API.

## Features

- Displays top headlines by category.
- Infinite scrolling for loading more news.
- Client-side caching using local storage to reduce API requests.
- Basic error handling for API issues.

## Setup and Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    `git clone https://github.com/abdullahdigital/true-news.git`
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    `cd true-news`
3.  Install dependencies:
    `npm install`
4.  Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your News API key:
    `VITE_NEWS_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY`
5.  Start the development server:
    `npm run start`

## API Key Management

For deployment platforms like Vercel, manage your API keys as environment variables directly within the platform's settings. This ensures your sensitive keys are not exposed in your codebase.
